# TXTFileAnalysis

The code retrieves a text file and analyses it by finding:
		frequency of each letter
		number of words
		number of lines
		most common letter
		most common word
		10 most common words
		percent vowels
		and the longest sentence. 
		
This relies mainly on an understanding of arrays, String methods and efficient for loops.
